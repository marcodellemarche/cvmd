## 🌙 Experience

**Senior Satellite Software Engineer** @ [SatCom Solutions](http://satcomsolutions.net) *(Jun 2026 - Present)*

Leading the software team responsible for the communication stack of a constellation of 24 low-Earth-orbit satellites.

- Redesigned the onboard firmware for attitude control systems, improving pointing accuracy by 15 arc-seconds and reducing fuel consumption by 8%.
- Built a predictive maintenance pipeline that ingested telemetry from all 24 satellites in real time, preventing 3 critical failures in its first year of operation.
- Mentored a team of 6 engineers across two continents, introducing trunk-based development and cutting release cycle time from 6 weeks to 10 days.

***Technologies:*** C/C++, Python, FreeRTOS, CAN bus, Kafka, Kubernetes, MATLAB.

**Satellite Repair Technician** @ [SatCom Solutions](http://satcomsolutions.net) *(Jan 2023 - Jun 2026)*

Conducted hands-on maintenance of communication satellites in geostationary and low-Earth orbit.

- Performed 12 EVA missions to service onboard hardware, achieving a 100% mission success rate.
- Reduced average satellite downtime by 40% by introducing a structured fault-diagnosis protocol adopted fleet-wide.
- Developed Python tooling to automate pre-EVA checklist verification, saving an average of 2 hours per mission.

***Technologies:*** Python, embedded C, satellite communication protocols, zero-gravity wrenches.
